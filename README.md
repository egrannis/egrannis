### Hi there! I'm Emma :computer: :wave:

I'm a recent Web Development grad from Lighthouse Labs' 12-week bootcamp. I have a background as a digital advertising and analytics team lead at a rapidly growing start-up. At this company, I discovered my passion for problem-solving and tech, creating basic automation flows and data visualizations for my team. Through exposure to the development team, I was also able to learn more about web products. Iâ€™m fascinated by how a system works comprehensively and aim to leverage my adaptiveness and background in collaboration to meet the challenges faced by web development teams.

I'm currently working on honing in on my React skills and learning TypeScript. From here, I plan to learn Python! 

:us: I'm seeking full-time opportunities in the US
